One might ask the question why bother to map some of the features in Scala to Java.

Why not use Scala?
If you like me walk between the Java/Scala you'll miss some of Scala's features when programming in pure Java. 
It's for these situations this project has been created. To allow plain Java users use some of goodies in Scala but without actually using Scala. 

The project will supply features such as:
* [Option/Some/None](https://github.com/pnerg/java-scala-util/wiki/option)
* [Try/Success/Failure](https://github.com/pnerg/java-scala-util/wiki/try)
* [Either/Left/Right](https://github.com/pnerg/java-scala-util/wiki/either)
* [Future/Promise](https://github.com/pnerg/java-scala-util/wiki/Future)

Once you start to use this library you will most likely build test cases for your code.  
To allow for a richer flora of asserts related (amongst others) to this project there is a side project called [junit-extensions](https://github.com/pnerg/junit-extensions)
