/**
 * Represents the type <i>scala.Unit</i>. <br>
 * The usage of <i>Unit</i> is for situations where one returns types such as {@link Try} or {@link
 * javascalautils.concurrent.Future Future} that are not meant to hold a value. <br>
 * E.g.
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * Try&lt;Unit&gt; deleteSynchronous(String id)
 * Future&lt;Unit&gt; deleteAsynchronous(String id)
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The example illustrates deleting something but the only thing we care of is if the operation was
 * successful.<br>
 * This becomes very apparent with the asynchronous method. In that case we only care if the
 * operation is finished and successful.<br>
 * One can of course return dummy objects/values but providing Unit is more concise as it clearly
 * marks a non-value. <br>
 * Instead of creating new instances it is recommended to use the {@link #Instance singleton}
 * instance.
