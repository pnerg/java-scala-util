/**
 * Contains utilities for concurrent/asynchronous programming. <br>
 * The core principle is the {@link javascalautils.concurrent.Promise}/{@link
 * javascalautils.concurrent.Future} pattern which is the way to separate the execution/job side
 * ({@link javascalautils.concurrent.Promise}) from the client/receiver side ({@link
 * javascalautils.concurrent.Future}). <br>
 *
 * <h2>Promise/Future</h2>
 *
 * In an essence the {@link javascalautils.concurrent.Promise} is the promise to deliver a value at
 * some time in the future.<br>
 * This is the handle the actual computation side of of the job uses. <br>
 * <br>
 * The {@link javascalautils.concurrent.Future} is the bearer of a value-to-be, an execution yet to
 * be finished. <br>
 * The purpose is to have a placeholder for a value from an asynchronous computation. <br>
 * The preferred way to get hold of the value-to-be is to register a listener on any of the provided
 * listener types since this allows for asynchronous non-blocking operations. <br>
 * The following image outlines an example of using a {@link
 * javascalautils.concurrent.Promise}/{@link javascalautils.concurrent.Future} pair.<br>
 * <br>
 * <img src="./doc-files/flowchart-future.png" alt="flowchart"><br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <h2>Executing a function</h2>
 *
 * In addition to manually using the {@link javascalautils.concurrent.Executor} class for performing
 * asynchronous computations one can let the {@link javascalautils.concurrent.Future} class deal
 * with that automatically. <br>
 * This is done by using {@link
 * javascalautils.concurrent.Future#apply(javascalautils.ThrowableFunction0) Future.apply} or
 * statically importing the {@link
 * javascalautils.concurrent.FutureCompanion#Future(javascalautils.ThrowableFunction0)
 * FutureCompanion.Future} method from the companion class to the {@link
 * javascalautils.concurrent.Future}. <br>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * <pre>
 * import static javascalautils.concurrent.FutureCompanion.Future;
 *
 * Future&lt;Integer&gt; resultSuccess = Future(() -&gt; 9 / 3); // The Future will at some point contain: Success(3)
 * Future&lt;Integer&gt; resultFailure = Future(() -&gt; 9 / 0); // The Future will at some point contain: Failure(ArithmeticException)
 * </pre>
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * The execution path for the above example is illustrated in the picture below.<br>
