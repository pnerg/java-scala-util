/**
 * Acts as a Scala type companion object for {@link Promise}. <br>
 * The primary purpose is to get the Scala feel of instantiating classes. <br>
 * In Scala you can define a companion object for a class, acting as a static reference/singleton
 * for that class allowing you do define factory methods.<br>
 * One use case is to define methods with the same name as the class and let these methods invoke
 * the constructor thus creating a nice way to create instances without using the word "new". <br>
 * This can be achieved in java by statically importing a method and then using it. <br>
 * The limitation is that classes may not have method with the same name as the class itself hence
 * new companion classes have to be created. <br>
 * To be able to use it in a neat concise way one needs to statically import the method.

 *
 * <pre>
 * import static javascalautils.PromiseCompanion.Promise;

 * Promise&lt;String&gt; promise = Promise();
