/**
 * The Promise is the promise to deliver a value at some time in the future. <br>
 * This is the handle the actual computation side of of the job uses. <br>
 * Once a job is finished it will report the outcome to the Promise which in turn relays it to the
 * Future the client/application is monitoring.<br>
 * A promise can be fulfilled either by invoking success or failure but not both. <br>
 * Nor can {@link #success(Object) success}/{@link #failure(Throwable) failure} be invoked twice.
 * <br>
 * The principle is that a {@link Promise} will deliver exactly one <i>successful</i> or
 * <i>failure</i> response. <br>
 * The successful response is of any type whilst the failure is expected to be of type (or subclass
 * of) {@link Throwable}. <br>
 * <br>
 * Together with a {@link Future} this allows a safe publication of asynchronously calculated
 * results into another thread. <br>
 * The basic principle is to first create a {@link Promise}. <br>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * Promise&#60;String&#62; promise = Promise.apply();
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Using that instance one can get hold of the {@link Future} that is the container for the
 * value-to-be. <br>
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * Future&#60;String&#62; future = promise.future();
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * To complete the Promise and by extension completing the Future one can use any of several
 * methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #success(Object)}
 *   <li>{@link #failure(Throwable)}
 *   <li>{@link #complete(Try)}
 *   <li>{@link #completeWith(Future)}
 * </ul>
 *
 * E.g.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * promise.success("Peter was here");
 *
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Note that only <u>one</u> of the methods may be invoked as the Promise can only be fulfilled
 * once. <br>
 * The above methods come with a variant <i>tryNNN</i> which allows for multiple invocations without
 * raising an exception. <br>
 * Though still only the first invocation/completion counts.
