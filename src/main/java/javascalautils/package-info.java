/**
 * Contains various utility classes translated from the Scala language. <br>
 * The following three types are all what is known as container types.<br>
 * They represent various use cases, such as containing one or zero value ({@link
 * javascalautils.Option}), one of two values ({@link javascalautils.Either}) and value or exception
 * ({@link javascalautils.Try}) The aim with these utility classes is to provide neat and concise
 * programming patterns. <br>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link javascalautils.Option}/{@link javascalautils.Some}/{@link javascalautils.None}
 *   <li>{@link javascalautils.Try}/{@link javascalautils.Success}/{@link javascalautils.Failure}
 *   <li>{@link javascalautils.Either}/{@link javascalautils.Left}/{@link javascalautils.Right}
 * </ul>
 *
 * It is possible to make transitions between the container types. <br>
 * This image below aims to illustrate the transitions that can be made and where they lead. <br>
